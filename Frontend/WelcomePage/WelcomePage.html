              COMMUNITY SERVICES
               We believe community service is essential to the holistic development of a child. Working together, kids learn to solve problems and make decisions and successfully contribute to their community. They connect local concerns with global issues and gain awareness of others.
               All this will serve them now and years later as they transition out of school and into the world.
